# What is Word of Mouth Marketing?

Consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their "daily dialogues"

* Why is this *new* in "social media"?
  * It isn't a new idea ...
  * The "social web" with it's increasing connectivity makes it more salient
  * ... and measurable

---
class: font160
# Types of Word of Mouth 

**Organic word of mouth**:

* People become advocates for a product and have a desire to share their views.
* **This is our focus**

**Amplified word of mouth**: 

* Marketers launch campaigns designed to encourage or accelerate WoM in existing or new communities.
* We'll come back to this later in the course -- "Social Advertising"

*Lurking Issue:* Online versus Offline

* Distinction is always lurking in the background

---
class: font160
# Social Media Word of Mouth Matters

* Consumers now spend more than 135 mins per day on social media

* Social Media fostered growing importance of WoM marketing

* Chief Marketing Officers think online WoM matters
    - ... Rationalized by consumer's trust in online info from peers (Nielsen, 2013)
    - 64% of marketing executives believe word of mouth is the most effective form of marketing
    - Only 6% say they have mastered it.

# Why Word of Mouth Might Matter

.center[
`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` What reasons might word of mouth matter for consumers?
]


---
class: font160
# Why Word of Mouth Might Matter

Mechanisms at play:

1. Awareness
2. Buzz
3. Social learning
4. Consumption complementarities

Most often we see this operationalized as:

* Awareness & Buzz $\rightarrow$ **volume** of tweets
* Social learning $\rightarrow$ **sentiment** in tweet's text
  * Sentiment often called *valence*
* Consumption complementarities $\rightarrow$ *nothing*

---
class: font160
# Why Should Marketers Care?

- Social media can generate awareness, buzz and information diffusion that ultimately influences demand

<br>

- Important when:
    1. Relying on "hyped release strategies"
    2. Uncertainty about a product's quality

<br>

- Examples: movies, books, consumer electronics, video games, fashion

.center[**Most relevant for new products early in release**]

# The paper...

**Strategic Question**: How does volume, valence and variance of online user reviews impact product demand? 

* Some definitions: 
  * **Online Word of Mouth**: user reviews on social media 
    * Thought of as different from star ratings 
  * **Valence** (aka *sentiment*): how positive / negative the reviews are

**Why relevant?** 

* Volume vs Valence effects are widely debated
* And (generally) hard to measure
* Relevant for new products, experience goods
  * Movie industry is a good laboratory for these products

---
class: font140
# Application: The Movie Industry

* Time period: November 2003 to February 2005

* Movies: 148 

* Yahoo! Movies discussion boards

* Opening weekend box office data across DMAs

* Why DMA level data important here? 
  1. Movies weren't always released across all of US on same day
  2. Allows different in OWoM metrics for the same movie on an "opening" weekend

**Why not an experiment?** 

* Experimental variation in volume and sentiment (almost) impossible
* Paper pre-dates the experimental revolution

# Variable Definitions 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_data.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Regression Model 

**Regression Equation**: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

$i$ is movie, $j$ is DMA (region)

**Coefficients of Interest**: $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3$

**Bells and Whistles (in method)**: 

* Endogeneity (offline vs online, omitted variables)
* Correlation in errors across markets

$\implies$ fix via Instrumental Variables + tweaks to standard error calculation you're used to

---
# Main Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Valence is** statistically significant 

**Volume is not**

---
# Comparison to National Aggregation 

.center[**National Demand is what people "usually" do**]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_national.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Valence is not** statistically significant , **Volume is**


---
class: font150
# Whats Causing this Difference? 

When we have **sequential** release of products

* Sentiment is "moving around more" than volume 
  * Why?
  * Pre-release volume >> post-release volume 
  * Can learn quality from consumers who have seen movie
* And sequential release was/is a strategic decision
  * In part due because firms want to leverage social learning

$\implies$ likely that we see sentiment effects

When we have **simultaneous** national release of products

* More variation in volume than sentiment 
* And sentiment is *noisy* for all products in the opening week

$\implies$ likely that we see volume effects

.font70[These thoughts are speculative on my part]

---
class: font160
# Takeaways from the paper

* Emphasizes the role of **valence** / **sentiment** of online reviews in influencing new product demand in experience goods markets 
  * In **contrast** to **volume**
  * Which is what previous studies emphasized

* Marketers should find ways to spread **positive** online WoM to boost demand

# Recent Developments I 

.center[
**Can we get experimental variation in volume and sentiment?**
]

* Maybe if there's a "Natural Experiment"
* Studied by [Seiler, Yao & Wang (2018)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1045) 

**Setting**: Shutdown of Sina Weibo in mainland China & but not HK
* Industry: Existing TV shows 

**Findings**: 

* Volume not sentiment is significant
* Small elasticities, approx 0.02 
* Mechanism at play is consumption complementarities 

---
class: font140
# Recent Developments II

.center[
**How far to "believable" numbers can get get without experimental variation?** 

**Can we reconcile the volume vs sentiment debate?**
]

* If we can **control** for (almost) all the omitted variables
* Studied by [Deer, Crawford, Chintagunta (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227912) 

**Setting**: US Movie Industry & Twitter WoM

**Findings**: 

* Distinguish Pre- vs Post- release volume and sentiment
* Volume **and** sentiment significant
* Small-ish volume elasticities, larger sentiment elasticities 
* Differs across **types** of movies
  *  Buzz: Franchise movies, 
  *  Awareness: (expected) mid-tier movies, 
  *  Social learning: (expected) small movies

# Viral Marketing

**Virality**: achieving a large number of views in a short time period due to consumers sharing content online. 


.center[
`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` What do marketers and managers care about virality?
]

* Ability to reach vast audiences in a short period of time at low cost
* Increases brand visibility and recognition $\rightarrow$ brand equity 
* (Increase in sales?)

* Lurking differences: Seeded virality vs non-seeded virality

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: How to design ads to *seed* a viral advertising campaign

Dimensions studied:

* Creativity: intruguing, entertaining, gains consumer's attention 
* Informativeness: provides needed information or essential facts

**Why relevant?** 

* Dimensions under a firm's control 
* At the expense of advertising effectiveness 


---

# Flow of the Paper: Lab Studies 

Multiple studies $\rightarrow$ "Typical" consumer behaviour style paper

**Study 1** Field data: Views of YouTube ads

* Do certain types of ads generate more virality in "real" data?

**Study 2**: Real Ads *and* circulation intentions 

* For propagators vs non-propagators 

**Study 3**: Vary creativity and informativeness of a focal ad

* Control the ad content
* Remove omitted variable bias driven by product category of the real ads

---
class: font160
# Study 1: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/propogate_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Creativity and informativeness positively correlated with views
* Propagators too 
  * Measured by number of comments ... so take this with a grain of salt


---
class: font140
# Study 2: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/propogate_study2_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Higher creativity associated with higher intent to disseminate
* Propogators even more likely when highly informative and highly creative

*Remark*: Propagator defined as "having friends" and "talking to them a lot"

---
# Study 3: Manipulating the Ad Content

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}

# Study 3: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/propogate_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Dissemination: 

* High creativity positively associated with intent to share
* High creativity and highly informative even more so for propagators 

Social Status elevation: (a mechanism)

* Propagators do this to elevate their social status

---
class: font160
# Takeaways

* Ads more likely to be shared when they are creative and informative 
  * Even more likely for more socially connected individuals

* Driven by socially connected individuals desire to elevate (perceived) social status

# When is viral content valuable for firms?

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: Can a firm create shareable ads that benefit brands?

i.e. ads that are

* Viral: highly shared, and 
* Valuable: impact KPIs of interest

**Why relevant?** 

* Rush for highly shareable ad content ...
* At the expense of advertising effectiveness 

.center["*Content aspects that increase sharing seem to decrease effectivess*"]

* Competing effects of informational vs emotional appeals

---
class: font150
# Flow of the Paper: Lab Studies 

Multiple studies $\rightarrow$ "Typical" consumer behaviour style paper

**Study 0** Examine sharing of online video ads

* Do certain types of ads generate more virality in "real" data?

**Study 1**: Experiment to test ad type on shares and brand outcomes

**Study 2**: Enriches Study 1 to ...

* Rule out alternative explanations 
* Test external validity

**Study 3**: Investigate mechanisms behind the effect

# Field Observation of Viral Ads 

Data: Unruly.co 

* Prominent viral ad tracking platform

Time: June 2003  

Outcome: Number of shares in 6 months after launch 

Covariates: 

* Informative vs Emotional on a 7 point scale 
* Integral-ness of brand to narrative

---
class: font150
# Field Observation: Findings 

* Trade off emotional ads vs brand integralness

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/vv_fig1.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Emotional ads are shared more than informative ads

* Informative ads are shared more when brand integral to narrative 
* Brand integral-ness not important in adds that emphasize emotional appeal

# Study 1: Setup


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study1_stimuli.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Lab Experiment: Undergrads @ Wharton

* Randomly assigned an ad, then asked 
  1. Willingness to share 
  2. Brand Evaluation 
  3. Purchase Likelihood

---

# Study 1: Results


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}

# Study 3

Same as Study 2, but 

* at Erasmus U
* Suggests mechanisms driving main effects  

Main results: 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study3_results_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

```

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* Emotional ads increase sharing 
* Informative ads increase brand evaluation and purchase intention 
* Emotional (brand) Integral ads combine both effects 
  * This is the "valuable virality" the authors care about
  * They argue  this is by:
    * (a) creating positive inferences about persuasion, and 
    * (b) increasing brand knowledge 
  * (... but I can't see a competing story being thoroughly tested) 


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Much debate about **volume versus sentiment** of user generated content and their **impacts on demand for products** 
  * Know which paper pushes which story and (intuitively) how 
  * Older estimates are large, **new estimates** are **much smaller** but significant 

* Ads more likely to be shared when they are creative and informative
  * Driven by socially connected people seeking to increase social status


* **Trade off** between **shareability** and **KPI performance** of ads 
  * "Valuably Viral" ads use emotion and branding to try and balance shareability and performance

# Tweeting as a Marketing Tool

---
class: font160
# Do Firm Tweets Matter?

**Motivation**: Does tweeting increase demand for their products

**Specific Questions**:

* What is the causal effect of company tweets on demand?
* Do retweets by influential users help?

**How?**: Large scale experiment on Weibo w/ a media company

* Note: (again) This paper is **very** cool

---
class: font160
# The Experiment

Weibo $\approx$ Chinese Twitter

Industry: documentary TV shows 

* One show broadcast per day across seven local channels

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_experiment.png")
```

---
# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="63%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_main.png")
```

---
# Results II 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_quant.png")
```

---
class: font150
# Main Takeaways

**Effects:**

* Tweeting: positive & significant effect
* Tweeting + Influential retweet: retweet gives a significant boost

**What's the mechanism?** (subtle)

* Influential tweets with broadcast time info attract new viewers
  *  Table 8 and 9
* Informative tweets (broadcast time) also attract new followers to company page

# Improvised Marketing Interventions

**Improvised Marketing Interventions (IMI)**: composition and execution of a real-time marketing communication
proximal to an external event

**Motivation**: Are IMI's effective at generating online sharing?

**Specific Questions**:

* Do IMI's result in greater virality?
* What type of IMI yields greater virality?
* Do IMIs enhance firm value?

**How?**: A mix of experiment, quasi-experiment and observational data

* We'll look at a subset of their results, focusing on the first two questions

# IMIs and Virality

**Context**: Superbowl blackout, 2013

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_tweet.jpg")
```

---
# Virality of Oreo Tweet

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_event.png")
```

---
# Virality of Oreo Tweet

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_results.png")
```

---
# Timeliness & Unanticipation

**Study 2**: mTurk Survey

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="30%", fig.show = 'hold', fig.ncol = 2}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figs/borah_timeliness.png", "figs/borah_anticipation.png"))
```


---
class: font160
# Marketing Implications

* IMI can help business connect with an audience weary of traditional advertising messages

* Humor and Timeliness important

* Keeping a close eye on trends and online chatter 
  * ... and being able to formulate a witty post/response

* Warning: Need to be careful that don't offend
  * Example: [Burger King on International Women's Day](https://globalnews.ca/news/7683800/burger-king-womens-day-kitchen-tweet/)

class: font160
# Viral Marketing

**Virality**: achieving a large number of views in a short time period due to consumers sharing content online.

# Viral Marketing

**Virality**: achieving a large number of views in a short time period due to consumers sharing content online. 


.center[
`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` What do marketers and managers care about virality?
]

* Ability to reach vast audiences in a short period of time at low cost
* Increases brand visibility and recognition $\rightarrow$ brand equity 
* (Increase in sales?)

* Lurking differences: Seeded virality vs non-seeded virality

# What Drives Virality?

class: font160
# What Drives Online Sharing?

**Motivation**: What characteristics of an ad enhance its shareability? 

**Specific Questions**:

* Does information focussed content limit sharing?
* Does brand prominence decrease sharing?
* Do positive emotions increase sharing?

**How?**: Online video ads on YouTube

* Note: Paper is descriptive / predictive rather than causal

---
class: font160
# YouTube Advertising Data

All video ads between Nov 25, 2013 and March 4, 2014

* Approx 1,962 video ads

Info they get via Youtube's API:

* Shares on Facebook, Twitter, Google +, LinkedIn over first 30 days

Info about Ads: sample of 360 of ads collected, covers 79 brands

* Got coders (i.e. paid some people) to watch ads and write down whats in it


---
# Ad Characteristics

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_ad_characs.png")
```

class: font140
# Regression Equation

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_regression.png")
```


Note: Think of this as a **descriptive** regression 

* They'll also use it for prediction on an (unseen) sample
* "Are these features predictive of shares?"  
  * My Q: If they really want to predict though, why not go machine learning route?

---
# Estimation Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_results.png")
```


---
class: font140
# Main Findings in Regression

* Information decreases shares
  * But not for a new products
  * And less for high price products

* Positive emotions lead to more shares
  * High arousal emotions not more effective than low arousal

* Timing of brand appearence and length of ad matters

**A critical eye**: They are cutting the data many ways for only 346 observations!

(Paper also discusses predictive power of model)

# Dramatic Elements and Emotions

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}

# Marketing Implications

Drivers of sharing important to understand to help ads get shared

* This sounds *a little too causal*
* ... as will a lot of their implications

The authors want us to believe:

* Less information
* More positive emotions 
* More careful brand placement

are important to promote online sharing

# When is viral content valuable for firms?

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: Can a firm create shareable ads that benefit brands?

i.e. ads that are

* Viral: highly shared, and 
* Valuable: impact KPIs of interest

**Why relevant?** 

* Rush for highly shareable ad content ...
* At the expense of advertising effectiveness 

.center["*Content aspects that increase sharing seem to decrease effectiveness*"]

* Competing effects of informational vs emotional appeals

---
class: font150
# Flow of the Paper: Lab Studies 

Multiple studies $\rightarrow$ "Typical" consumer behaviour style paper

**Study 0** Examine sharing of online video ads

* Do certain types of ads generate more virality in "real" data?

**Study 1**: Experiment to test ad type on shares and brand outcomes

**Study 2**: Enriches Study 1 to ...

* Rule out alternative explanations 
* Test external validity

**Study 3**: Investigate mechanisms behind the effect

# Field Observation of Viral Ads 

Data: Unruly.co 

* Prominent viral ad tracking platform

Time: June 2003  

Outcome: Number of shares in 6 months after launch 

Covariates: 

* Informative vs Emotional on a 7 point scale 
* Integral-ness of brand to narrative

---
class: font150
# Field Observation: Findings 

* Trade off emotional ads vs brand integralness

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/vv_fig1.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Emotional ads are shared more than informative ads

* Informative ads are shared more when brand integral to narrative 
* Brand integral-ness not important in adds that emphasize emotional appeal

---
class: font150
# Study 1: Setup


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study1_stimuli.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Lab Experiment: Undergrads @ Wharton

* Randomly assigned an ad, then asked 
  1. Willingness to share 
  2. Brand Evaluation 
  3. Purchase Likelihood

---
class: font150
# Study 1: Results


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[Emotional integral "best of both worlds"]

---
class: font150
# Study 2: Setup


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study2_stimuli.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Lab Experiment: Undergrads @ MEF

---
# Study 2: Results


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study2_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font150
# Study 3

Same as Study 2, but 

* at Erasmus U
* Suggests mechanisms driving main effects  

Main results: 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study3_results_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Study 3: Mechanisms


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study3_results_mediation.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* Emotional ads increase sharing 
* Informative ads increase brand evaluation and purchase intention 
* Emotional (brand) Integral ads combine both effects 
  * This is the "valuable virality" the authors care about
  * They argue  this is by:
    * (a) creating positive inferences about persuasion, and 
    * (b) increasing brand knowledge 
  * (... but I can't see a competing story being thoroughly tested)

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Company tweets (these are ads) can generate demand, influential retweets even more
  * mechanism: attracting a new audience 

* Improvised Marketing Interventions are heavily shared when they are timely and involve humor and aren't anticipated

* Features of ads that are associated with increased virality:
  * Feature positive emotions
  * Are less informative
    * There are exceptions here - new products, expensive products
  * Careful placement of brand name

* **Trade off** between **shareability** and **KPI performance** of ads 
  * "Valuably Viral" ads use emotion and branding to try and balance shareability and performance

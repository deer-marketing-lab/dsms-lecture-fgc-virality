# Online User Reviews & Movie Box Office Performance

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: How does volume, valence and variance of online user reviews impact product demand? 

* Some definitions: 
  * **Online Word of Mouth**: user reviews on social media 
    * Thought of as different from star ratings 
  * **Valence** (aka *sentiment*): how positive / negative the reviews are

**Why relevant?** 

* Volume vs Valence effects are widely debated
* And (generally) hard to measure
* Relevant for new products, experience goods
  * Movie industry is a good laboratory for these products

class: font140
# Data 

* Time period: November 2003 to February 2005

* Movies: 148 

* Yahoo! Movies discussion boards

* Opening weekend box office data across DMAs

* Why DMA level data important here? 
  1. Movies weren't always released across all of US on same day
  2. Allows evolution in OWoM metrics for the same movie on an "opening" weekend

**Why not an experiment?** 

* Experimental variation in volume and sentiment (almost) impossible
* Paper pre-dates the experimental revolution

# Variable Definitions 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_data.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Regression Model 

**Regression Equation**: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_regression.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

$i$ is movie, $j$ is DMA (region)

**Variables of Interest**: $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3$

**Bells and Whistles (in method)**: 

* Endogeneity (offline vs online, omitted variables)
* Correlation in errors across markets

$\implies$ fix via Instrumental Variables + tweaks to standard error calculation you're used to

---
# Main Results 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Valence is** statistically significant 

**Volume is not**

---
# Comparison to National Aggregation 

.center[**National Demand is what people "usually" do**]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/cgv_national.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Valence is not** statistically significant , **Volume is**

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* Emphasizes the role of **valence** / **sentiment** of online reviews in influencing new product demand in experience goods markets 
  * In **contrast** to **volume**
  * Which is what previous studies emphasized

* Marketers should find ways to spread **positive** online WoM to boost demand

# Recent Developments I 

.center[
**Can we get experimental variation in volume and sentiment?**
]

* Maybe if there's a "Natural Experiment"
* Studied by [Seiler, Yao & Wang (2018)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1045) 

**Setting**: Shutdown of Sina Weibo in mainland China & but not HK
* Industry: Existing TV shows 

**Findings**: 

* Volume not sentiment is significant
* Small elasticities, approx 0.02 
* Mechanism at play is consumption complementarities 

---
class: font150
# Recent Developments II

.center[
**How far to "believable" numbers can get get without experimental variation?** 
]

* If we can **control** for (almost) all the omitted variables (offline stuff)
* Studied by [Deer, Crawford, Chintagunta (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227912) 

**Setting**: US Movie Industry & Twitter WoM

**Findings**: 

* Distinguish Pre- vs Post release volume and sentiment
* Volume **and** sentiment significant
* Small-ish volume elasticities, larger sentiment elasticities 
* Differs across **types** of movies
* Mechanisms: Buzz, awareness, social learning

# Valuable Virality 

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: Can a firm create shareable ads that benefit brands?

i.e. ads that are

* Viral: highly shared, and 
* Valuable: impact KPIs of interest

**Why relevant?** 

* Rush for highly shareable ad content ...
* At the expense of advertising effectiveness 

.center["*Content aspects that increase sharing seem to decrease effectivess*"]

* Competing effects of informational vs emotional appeals

---
class: font150
# Flow of the Paper 

Multiple studies $\rightarrow$ "Typical" consumer behaviour style paper

**Study 0** Examine sharing of online video ads

* Do certain types of ads generate more virality in "real" data?

**Study 1**: Experiment to test ad type on shares and brand outcomes

**Study 2**: Enriches Study 1 to ...

* Rule out alternative explanations 
* Test external validity

**Study 3**: Investigate mechanisms behind the effect

# Field Observation of Viral Ads 

Data: Unruly.co 

* Prominent viral ad tracking platform

Time: June 2003  

Outcome: Number of shares in 6 months after launch 

Covariates: 

* Informative vs Emotional on a 7 point scale 
* Integral-ness of brand to narrative

---
class: font150
# Field Observation: Findings 

* Trade off emotional ads vs brand integralness

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/vv_fig1.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Emotional ads are shared more than informative ads

* Informative ads are shared more when brand integral to narrative 
* Brand integral-ness not important in adds that emphasize emotional appeal

---
class: font150
# Study 1: Setup


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study1_stimuli.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Lab Experiment: Undergrads @ Wharton

* Randomly assigned an ad, then asked 
  1. Willingness to share 
  2. Brand Evaluation 
  3. Purchase Likelihood

---
class: font150
# Study 1: Results


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[Emotional integral "best of both worlds"]

---
class: font150
# Study 2: Setup


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study2_stimuli.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Lab Experiment: Undergrads @ MEF

# Study 2: Results


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study2_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font150
# Study 3

Same as Study 2, but 

* at Erasmus U
* Tries to get at mechanisms via mediation analysis 

Main results: 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study3_results_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Study 3: Mechanisms


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/vv_study3_results_mediation.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* Emotional ads increase sharing 
* Informative ads increase brand evaluation and purchase intention 
* Emotional (brand) Integral ads combine both effects 
  * This is the "valuable virality" the authors care about
  * They argue  this is by:
    * (a) creating positive inferences about persuasion, and 
    * (b) increasing brand knowledge 
  * (... but I can't see a competing story being thoroughly tested)

# Online Firestorms in Brand Communities 

---
class: font160
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: How can a firm detect, prevent and mitigate online firestorms in brand communities

* **Online Firestorm**: negative OWoM that gets substantial support from other customers quickly


**Why relevant?** 

* 72% of firms rate preparedness for online firestorms as below average
* Limited understanding at how to deal with negative OWoM 
* Difficulty predicting what happens when negative OWoM propagates through a large audience

---
# Online Firestorm Erupting

# Online Firestorm Prevention 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}

# Data 

**Source**: Facebook Brand Communities for S&P 500 companies 

**Date Range**: October 2011 to Jan 2016

**Sample**: 472,995 negative posts across 89 online brand communities

**Important Definitions**:

* SST = strength of structural ties
  * Likes + comments $\times$ Given / received in community by a poster 

* LSM = linguistic similarity
  * How similar is complaining customers language with that of the existing posts in brand community

**Lurking question?** Firestorms vs Product Harm crises? 

* Firestorms emerge and end usually within 24 hours

Remark: Everything here is **correlation**

* Don't be swayed by authors want to interpret causally

# Recap 

---
class: font160
# Summary 

* Much debate about **volume versus sentiment** of user generated content and their **impacts on demand for products** 
  * Know which paper pushes which story and (intuitively) how 
  * Older estimates are large, **new estimates** are **much smaller** but significant 
* **Trade off** between **shareability** and **KPI performance** of ads 
  * "Valuably Viral" ads use emotion and branding to try and balance both 
* Responding to **online firestorms** requires managers to **respond in a fast and tailored way**
  * Eg: High arousal $\rightarrow$ explanation 
  * Vary use of empathy and explanation if needing to reply to multiple messages around same issue
